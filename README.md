# ButterFlies-CLassification
Butterfly classification involves categorizing species based on physical traits like wing patterns and colors. Machine learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used to automate this process by training on large datasets of labeled butterfly images. This aids in ecological studies and conservation efforts.
